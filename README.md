# Introduction

Welcome to the React Boilerplate Generator package! This package makes it easy for you to get started on your next React project by providing a customizable, ready-to-use boilerplate.

With this package, you'll be able to quickly set up a React app with Axios for HTTP requests, route protection for public, authenticated, and unauthenticated routes, and Redux Toolkit for state management. This boilerplate will give you a solid foundation to build your application upon, allowing you to focus on building out the features that matter to you.

## Get Started

To get started, simply install the package globally with

### Step 1
`npm i @muddledluck/boilerplate-cli -g`

### Step 2
Just type `mycli` in your `terminal` and then choose the template and in no time, you'll have a fully functional React app ready to go!
